      <li><h3>Network Marketing - Tehran</h3></li>
      <p>
        Contrary to the different opinions about network marketing, it was a
        really good experience for me because it made me gain a lot of ability
        and it was very useful for learning to sell and creating the ability to
        introduce and support the product, apart from The nature of my work, I
        had a year full of challenges and learning, and it had a great impact on

      <li><h3>B2B Sales at DR.NEXT - Tehran</h3></li>
      <p>
        My challenging work experience in the field of sales and branding at Dr.
        Next, which is a company that provides an electronic prescription
        platform, was really a useful experience for me, but as I moved forward,
        I realized that selling and creating a sense of satisfaction in the
        customer is really for me. It's interesting and I was able to measure my
        older experiences in the form of big startups and this was really great
        for me In addition, Dr. Next was like a university for me and every day
        was a new experience.
